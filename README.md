Backend Developer
Entry level test
Hi!
Our team here at Napptilus Tech Labs just received a
requirement to develop a website to manage the Oompa
Loompa&#39;s crew of Willy Wonka&#39;s chocolate factory. Some
kind of help to the company’s Human Resources dpt. (they
are very modern in some aspects and they have
smartphones and access to the Internet, for instance).
However, we need you to help Willy Wonka to code a server that provides a tool to manage
all Oompa Loompas.
Each Oompa Loompa owns the following information:
- Name
- Age
- Job
- Height
- Weight
- Description


The server must fulfill the following API features:
- Get the list of Oompa Loompas. For that list, only name, age and job are required per
Oompa Looma.
- Get the full detail of an Oompa Loompa
- Add a new Oompa Loompa
- Edit a current Oompa Loompa

Specifications:
- Use Spring Boot framework
- Use as many third party libraries as you want but, please, document all libraries you
have used and explain the reason why you’ve used them.
- Use docker
- Use either Couchbase, MongoDB or MySql for your database

Bonus:
- Be creative!
- Error handling
- Response caching
- Hystrix usage
- RxJava/reactor usage
- Paginate the list of Oompa Loompas
- Fork your repo and use a different database

This test is aimed at knowing how you code a server, the technical decisions you take along
the process and the overall cleanliness of your code. Happy coding! Please share a Github
repository with us or just send a Zip file.
